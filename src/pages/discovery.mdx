# Discovery

By design, the GNAP minimizes the need for any pre-flight discovery. To start things off, the client only needs to know the transaction endpoint of the server, everything else can be negotiated dynamically. For example, the client indicates all of its supported interaction modes for a given transaction request, and the AS responds to whichever ones from that set that it supports with the appropriate information for that interaction mode.

Even so, the protocol allows for some additional discovery mechanisms.

## Options Discovery

The client can also send an HTTP `OPTIONS` request to the transaction endpoint to get a JSON document describing the server. 

<Code 
  from="client" to="as"
  language='http' codeString={`OPTIONS /transaction HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com`} />

<Code 
  from="as" to="client"
  language='json' code={{
  "capabilities": ["foo", "extension-A", "extension-B"],
  "interact_methods": ["callback", "redirect", "user_code"],
  "key_proofs": ["jwsd", "mtls", "httpsig", "dpop", "oauthpop", "jws"],
  "tx_endpoint": "http://host.docker.internal:9834/api/as/transaction"
}} />

Clients can use this information to pre-configure an optimized request to the AS, if desired. However, note that this method of discovery is not required to start a transaction.

Also note that presence of a value in the discovery document is not a guarantee that a client can use that feature. An AS is not obligated to allow any particular client or transaction request to use a given feature. For example, a client might be registered with a particular key proofing type and can therefore only use that type, even if the server supports others.
