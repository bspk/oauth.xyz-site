# Continuation Request

A continuation request is a form of request that continues the transaction for one of a number of reasons, based on the kind of interaction pattern that the client is capable of performing. 

 - The client has received a callback during <Link to="/interaction">Interaction</Link> with the user
 - The client is waiting for the user to take some action and is polling the request
 - The client has received information in response to a server challenge that will allow the request to progress

<ContinueRequest />

## Interaction Reference

If the client instance has received an interaction reference through one of the interaction `finish` mechanisms, the client will send that reference back to the AS.

<Code code={{
    "interact_ref": "4IFWWIKYBC2PQ6U56NL1"
}}/>

Note that the client instance has to validate the interaction hash before sending this reference back or else leave itself open to several forms of injection attack. Se the <Link to="/interaction">interaction</Link> page for more details.

## Continuation Updates

If the client instance wants to request additional access token rights or additional subject information, the client instance can do so by sending the same `access_token` and `subject` fields as it would inside the initial request. 

The client instance could also send a `user` field if it has learned additional information about the current user that it wants to present to the AS.

The continuation request is tied to a specific client instance, and so the `client` field can't be sent in any continuation request.

## Canceling an Ongoing Request

If the client instance wants to cancel an ongoing request, whether it's been granted or not, it can send an HTTP `DELETE` request to the continuation URL.

## Response

The AS responds to a transaction continuation request with a standard <Link to="/response">response</Link>. Note that the AS can respond with a different `continue` field than that used in the transaction continuation request, in which case the client instance needs to use the new values of the access token and uri within that section.

## Authentication

A continuation request is always authenticated using the continuation access token issued in the `continue` section of the initial <Link to="/response">response</Link>. Since this token is always bound to the client instance's key, this request is always signed.
