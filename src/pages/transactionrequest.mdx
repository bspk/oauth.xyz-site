# Transaction Request

The client begins the transaction by creating a transaction request. This is a `JSON` document `POST`ed to the authorization server's transaction endpoint. This request starts the transaction regardless of the type of client, the type of resource being accessed, or the type of authorizations needed to access said resources. 

The transaction request contains several parts:
 - `resources` contains a list of resources that the client is requesting access to
 - `claims` contains a set of claims about the current end user that the client is requesting from the AS
 - `key` contains information about the key the client is able to provide proof of possession for during this transaction and any related actions
 - `display` includes information about how the client software making the request
 - `interact` contains information about how the client is able to get the user to interact with the AS, if necessary
 - `user` contains assertions about the current user that the client knows
 - `capabilities` allows a client to list large pieces of functionality and extensions that it can support
 
Each ot these sections is optional and can be also sent as a handle instead. When sent as a handle, the AS looks up the handle value to determine the values associated with that handle. The AS can also limit which values can be used together, such as only allowing certain callback URIs or display information for a particular key handle. 

Note that the JSON in all sections is potentially multimodal. That is to say, when sent as a fully-formed request, it is a JSON `object`. When sent as a handle, it is sent as a JSON `string`. 

This example shows how the different sections can be composed with each other in a transaction request.

<TransactionRequest />

Each of the sections is detailed below. The AS will send a <Link to="/transactionresponse">transaction response</Link> in response.

## Display

The `display` section describes the client software that is making the request. This information can be used during any interaction with the user that the AS might need to do, and for auditing and review of authorization decisions. 

The AS can statically issue a display handle to a piece of software (or its developer) to be used in place of this section. In this way, it takes the place of the `client_id` and `client_secret` of OAuth 2. In these cases, the AS will likely also keep references to which `resources` the client can ask for, which `interact` methods it is allowed to use, which `key`s it is allowed to present, and even what kinds of `user` information it can assert. 

An AS can also dynamically generate a display handle and return it to the client during the initial transaction response. This handle can be used by the same piece of software to identify itself in future transactions.

## Resources

The `resources` parameter contains a list of all resources and APIs the client wishes to access. Each object in this array lists the types of actions the client can take, the URIs where those actions can be taken, and the kinds of data that the client expects access to. 

<Code code={{
          type: "example.com/resource-set",
          actions: ["read", "write", "dolphin"],
          locations: ["https://server.example.net/", "https://resource.local/other"],
          datatypes: ["metadata", "images"]
}} />

An AS can publish pre-set resources as resource handles that can be passed by the client to the AS during a transaction request, similar to OAuth 2's `scope` concept. The AS can determine a default set of resources for a client not asking for anything specifically.

An AS can also dynamically generate a resources handle and return it to the client during the initial transaction response. This handle can be used by the same piece of software to identify this same kind of request in future transactions.

The client can send several of these objects of handles in a single request, which the AS interprets as the client requesting access to all of the resources. 

> We could also have a means for the client to request multiple tokens using a different syntax. Instead of a top-level array, the top level could be an object whose keys are token identifiers decided by the client and whose values are the arrays from a single-token resource request.

## Claims

The `claims` parameter lets the client request information about the user. The presence of this field indicates to the AS that the client wants to know who is logged in at the AS during the interaction process. 

This is distinct from the `user` parameter below, which contains information that the client already knows about the current user. 

## Interact

The `interact` parameter lets the client tell the AS how to get a user to interact with the AS during a transaction. A client could be capable of multiple forms of interaction with the user, from redirecting to an arbitrary URL, to displaying a user code, to relaying messages to another piece of software. 

More detail is found in the <Link to="/interaction">Interaction</Link> section.

> Do we care about an interact handle? Redirect based clients need to send a new `nonce` parameter every time anyway, and could potentially send a new callback URL while they're at it. Any matching on callback URI's can be tied to keys and would need to have the same rules as a dynamic registration system would have anyway. 

## Key

The `keys` parameter lets the client tell the AS which keys it is able to prove ownership of during the course of the transaction. The `proof` parameter indicates how the client can provide proof of those keys, and may be one of `jwsd`, `httpsig`, or `mtls`. 

The AS can statically issue a key handle to a piece of software (or its developer). An AS can also dynamically generate a key handle and return it to the client during the initial transaction. This handle can be used by the same piece of software to identify its keys in future transactions. The key handle stands in for both the key and its proof mechanism. The key handle does not need to be derived from the key ID, CN, or other identifying information found in the key itself. 

Any keys referenced here, whether directly by value or by reference through a handle, have to be proved by the client during every request in the transaction. More detail is found in the <Link to="/keys">Keys</Link> section. 

> We need a mechanism for the AS to issue keys to the client during this process, and to acknowledge that it's accepted the presentation and proof of any keys sent by the client.

## User

The `user` parameter lets the client pass information to the AS about the current user in the form of an assertion or other set of claims gathered from a trusted source. These claims need to be able to be validated by the AS, and it should be additionally validated that the client is an authorized holder of this information. 

While this does not necessarily prove that the user in question is actually present with the client, it can allow the AS to make authorization decisions without user interaction in appropriately trusted scenarios.

The AS can dynamically generate a user handle and return it to the client in the transaction response. This handle can be used by the same piece of software to identify the same user in future transactions. In this way, it is similar to the persistent claims token from UMA 2.

This is distinct from the `claims` parameter above, which is about the client asking for information about the current user.

## Capabilities

The `capabilities` parameter lets the client tell the AS about extensions and functions to the XYZ protocol that it can support. If the client sends this parameter, the AS returns its own `capabilities` array selecting which of the client's functions it can support. The client can then self-configure for the ensuing transaction based on these values. If the client does not include this block in the request, the AS does not return a `capabilities` array in the response. 

> Could the client send a request with only the `capabilities` block to effectively do a discovery/registration in one step?

The values in the `capabilities` array map to specific features or extensions. 

> This needs to be a registry and the core spec needs to have clear definitions on how to build these extensions, including which sections and actions they affect. 

# Continuation Request

A transaction continuation request is a form of transaction request that continues the transaction for one of a number of reasons, based on the kind of interaction pattern that the client is capable of performing.

 - The client has received a callback on the front channel during <Link to="/interaction">Interaction</Link> with the user
 - The client is waiting for the user to take some action and is polling the transaction
 - The client has received information in response to a server challenge that will allow the transaction to progress

A transaction continuation request always includes the current transaction handle. If the AS responds to a transaction continuation request with a <Link to="/transactionresponse">Transaction Response</Link>, the transaction handle in that response is different from the one used in the transaction continuation request. 

In this example, the client passes its interaction reference from a front channel callback along with the transaction handle.

<Code
  from="client" to="as"
  code={{
    handle: "80UPRY5NM33OMUKMKSKU",
    interact_ref: "4IFWWIKYBC2PQ6U56NL1"
  }} />
