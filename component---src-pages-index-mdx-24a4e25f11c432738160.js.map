Even so, in its wide use, the protocol has come up against some of its own limitations. This is a proposal for a transactional authorization protocol XYZ to address the things that OAuth 2 doesn't handle well on its own. Optimizations and decisions that made sense in OAuth 2 don't make as much sense today. We are in a different world, and `}<a href=\"https://medium.com/@justinsecurity/moving-on-from-oauth-2-629a00133ade\">{`perhaps it's time we started to look to a different protocol`}</a>{`.`}</MDXTag>\n      <MDXTag name=\"p\" components={components}>{`But we're not trying to invent something in a vacuum. In particular, OAuth 2 has been extended to cover a wide variety of client applications, deployments, and use cases. While this flexibility and extensibility is one of OAuth 2's strengths, this has unfortunately led to a number of components that are almost--but not quite--solving the same problems in similar ways. PKCE, UMA, CIBA, OBUK, FAPI, and a host of other extensions to OAuth 2 make use of temporary credentials to let the protocol behave in new ways. `}</MDXTag>\n      <MDXTag name=\"p\" components={components}>{`This protocol, which I'm calling \"XYZ\" for the moment, is based on a transactional model. The client of the API declares who it is and what it wants, the AS figures out what information it needs to fulfill that (which might include interacting with a user), and ultimately a token is produced. All along the way, components have the opportunity to bind keys to different parts of the transaction so that attackers can't take over. This intent-based system takes in experience and feedback from other similar projects and protocols, but in a way that pulls together many different aspects. `}</MDXTag>\n      <MDXTag name=\"p\" components={components}>{`The XYZ protocol is `}<MDXTag name=\"em\" components={components} parentName=\"p\">{`not intended to be directly compatible with OAuth 2`}</MDXTag>{`, much in the same way that OAuth 2 was not directly compatible with OAuth 1. However, the concepts and many of the goals should feel familiar to developers used to these existing protocols and their extensions.

If the client is told to wait (as in a multi-device or multi-party authorization process), it can poll the transaction endpoint again after the indicated time window. After successful interaction, the client will continue a transaction with the authorization server. This can result in additional responses to continue the transaction, as needed.`}</MDXTag>\n      <MDXTag name=\"p\" components={components}>{`The AS might instead determine that no interaction from a user is required, such as is the case in OAuth 2's client credentials and assertion flows, and UMA 2's push-based claims flows.
